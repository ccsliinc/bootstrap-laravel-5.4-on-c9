# Bootstrap Laravel 5.4 With PHP-7 on Cloud9
This bash script makes creating a Laravel project on Cloud9 more easier for developers.

### How to use
- Create a PHP workspace on Cloud9, add the file to the root of your PHP project directory.
- Make the bash script executable by running this command like so: **chmod +x create.sh**.
- Finally you craft the Laravel project by executing this command: **./create.sh**.

### What it does
After executing the command, the following happens:

- PHP is upgraded to version 7.0
- Laravel is installed and a new Laravel project is created for you.
- **/public** is added to **DocumentRoot /home/ubuntu/workspace/** so it becomes *DocumentRoot /home/ubuntu/workspace/__public__*
- MySQL Command *__(mysql-ctl cli)__* tool is executed.
