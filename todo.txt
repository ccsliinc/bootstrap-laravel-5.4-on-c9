Don't worry there's an easy fix. You just need to do the following:

Add the following to the app/Providers/AppServiceProvider boot method:
Schema::defaultStringLength(191);

Don't forget to include the following at the top of the file:
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

Now you're safe to run 'php artisan migrate'
